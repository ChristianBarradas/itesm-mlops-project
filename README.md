# MLOPs Project - Predicting House Prices (Keras - Artificial Neural Network)

## Introduction of the project

Our MLOps project proposes to address these challenges by merging data science and software engineering in a synergistic collaboration. The objective of the project is to carry out a proof of concept where the implementation of a machine learning model (Artificial Neural Network) will be sought, developing the different stages of MLOps, up to the use of Docker Compose for the deployment of the model.

## About the project

The overall goal of this project is to create a robust and reproducible MLOps workflow for developing, training, and deploying machine learning models. A neural network will be used as proof of concept due, and will be applied to the house price predict data set to predict the price of houses in King County, which includes Seattle.

This project covers the following topics:

1. **Key concepts of ML systems**  
The objective of this module is to give an introduction to MLOps, life cycle and architecture examples is also given.

2. **Basic concepts and tools for software development**  
This module focuses on introducing the principles of software development that will be used in MLOps. Consider the configuration of the environment, tools to use, and best practices, among other things.

3. **Development of ML models**  
This module consists of showing the development of an ML model from experimentation in notebooks, and subsequent code refactoring, to the generation of an API to serve the model.

4. **Deployment of ML models**  
The objective of this module is to show how a model is served as a web service to make predictions.

5. **Integration of concepts**  
This module integrates all the knowledge learned in the previous modules. A demo of Continuous Delivery is implemented.

### Baseline

This MLOps project focuses on demonstrating the implementation of a complete workflow ranging from data preparation to exposing a local web service to making predictions using a neural network. The chosen data set is home sales prices in King County, including Seattle. Includes houses for sale between May 2014 and May 2015.

The purpose is to establish a starting point or "baseline" that will serve as a reference to evaluate future improvements and not only more complex algorithms but more complex components and further deployments.

### Scope

This project is planned to cover the topics seen in the course syllabus, which was designed to include technical capacity levels 0, 1 and a small part of 2 of [Machine Learning operations maturity model - Azure Architecture Center | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/mlops/mlops-maturity-model).

In other words, knowledge is integrated regarding the learning of good software development practices and Dev Ops (Continuous Integration) applied to the deployment of ML models.
